This repository contains the codes that are used to generate the data in  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00365](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00365)

The file **two_oscillators_qubits.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook containing the code used to generate Fig.2 and Fig.3, i.e. the entanglement properties 
of two nonlinear oscillators in their qubit representation, as described in the manuscript.

The file **single_oscillator.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook containing the code used to generate Fig.4, i.e. the oscillation frequency shift 
expected for a single nonlinear oscillator as a function of the initial amplitude.
